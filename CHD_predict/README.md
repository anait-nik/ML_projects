# Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease


## Description
World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications.

## Task
The task is to predict whether patient have 10 year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) or not.

## Dataset
The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. There are 3390 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute in the dataset is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.

## Libraries
*pandas, numpy, missingo, seaborn, plotly, phik, sklearn, catboost, imblearn*

## Tested ML models
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Cat Boost Classifier

## Results
Best ML model is Random Forest Classifier:

ROC AUC score: 0.95  
Accuracy: 0.88  
Precision: 0.90  
Recall: 0.87  
F1: 0.88  
Specificity 0.90.
